# Persona-4-Golden-All-XP
This mod is a simple injection which hands out xp for inactive party members based on the amount of xp that the protagonist gains from battle. It has a config so you can personally scale the amount of xp that inactive party members receive.

To use the mod, use any tool that can inject a dll, and inject it into the Persona 4 Golden process after loading a file.
